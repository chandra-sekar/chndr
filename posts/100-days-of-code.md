Now that we are in lockdown, a lot of people have been posting about using this time to learn things. I happen to be in a position where I can
actually afford the time for this. So I have decided to get started on the #100daysofcode
challenge. I am usually not a fan of doing things for the sake of doing it. The
original challenge requires you to do atleast one hour of coding every day. I am
not going to pressure myself into maintaining this streak. I will be happy if I
can finish this by the end of this year. There are 263 days left. Let's go :D
