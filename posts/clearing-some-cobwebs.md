It has been a while since I paid any attention at all to this site. My goal for this weekend is to finally remove the under construction banner and have a decent page up. This whole thing of designing in the browser is not working for me. I think I will try moving into a design tool to try some layouts before I get into code. I am also seriously considering moving to next.js from eleventy. Eleventy is great but I want a more familiar environment for data fetching etc. I am okay as long as I get to keep the posts in markdown so that I don't lose any of the content. [Astro](https://astro.build) looks very interesting but it is too new and I am sure they will introduce breaking changes. So here we go. Consider this a 24 hours challenge if you will. Let us see how far I can get.
