I finally did it. I kept opening and checking my Timeline out of habit. There was always something interesting to read and watch. But I felt it was gnawing away at my attention. I will wait and see how long I last before activating it again. I need to activate it before 30 days, or I'll lose my account permanently. Maybe it is not such a bad thing. I will decide when the time is near. I don't want to regret it later on. I feel deleting Whatsapp will have a bigger impact, but the last time I tried it, I felt disconnected from everybody.
