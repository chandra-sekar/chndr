I want to record my process of building this site. However, writing a blog post for every update can get boring very fast. I instead want to only record the thought process and major decisions as blog posts here, while putting up routine technical updates on a separate changelog page (again copying from Kylie :D)

I wrote the first post thinking no one would read it, and did not care about how it looked. But it was a mistake, and I pity Kylie for having to read long lines of unformatted text. First order of things is to treat this as a proper HTML page and add some inline styles. I would then be able to add hyperlinks and images without being bothered just because I called it a 'text file with some paragraph tags'.

Second thing to do would be to actually pull this repo onto my local machine so that I don't have to edit this on Github everytime :D
