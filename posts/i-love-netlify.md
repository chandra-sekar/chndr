This page was previously hosted using Github pages. After I added Eleventy, I figured I wanted to serve the page from a different folder, which will contain the static build of the site. This meant I had to either change the name of the build folder in eleventy or do a hack involving Git submodules.

Figured I will give <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> a try, because everyone has been raving about it. I thought I was just noodling around with the settings but before I knew it, the site was running on Netlify with automatic builds and a HTTPS certificate. And all this for no cost (this bothers me a little). No wonder they are recommended by so many people. It is an example of making the user look <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019" target="_blank">Badass</a>. Well done.
