I am writing this in the middle of a [worldwide pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic). Most of the world is in lockdown and slipping into a recession. This is day 20 of a nation wide lock down in India, and I haven't stepped out of my house in the past two weeks. So many workers have been rendered jobless. The world seems to be coming apart. I am writing this here to record my state of mind at this time - I feel strangely peaceful.

A lot of it is privilege. I am lucky to be able to do my job and still get paid for it. Most of all, I am lucky to have my family around me at this time. All four of us are cooped together in our house and we have our meals together daily. I am seeing my dad stay at home for the longest stretch of time in memory. My brother, who has been away studying, is also at home for the longest stretch since he started his course. The only thing that bothers me is the feeling that all this will be short lived. But there is no point worrying about the future. I feel grateful for what I have today.

Back at the beginning of the year, I had written about how optimistic I was about this year because 2020 was the beginning of a decade and all that. Well, we are not going to forget this year, that's for sure. I still feel all this will end good and this is a good opportunity for everyone to wipe the slate clean and begin again.

Here is to hope ðŸ¥‚
