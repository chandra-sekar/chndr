I am pretty chuffed right now. I finally connected this site to Netlify CMS. This means I don’t have to open a text editor on my desktop and push to Github every time I need to post something. I am writing this on my iPad and I am pretty happy with this setup. It took me around 30 minutes to set it up. Should have done this sooner. Without further ado, here are the notes from last week:

- Last week was pretty interesting. Entering the week, I had a pretty solid morning routine and I was quite happy with how I was doing. I had quit the diet, but I was feeling pretty much in control. That is, until my parents went on a holiday. Hey They left home on Wednesday leaving me alone at home and my routine went for a toss. I woke up late, skipped meals, did not attend a single workout class, ordered junk on swiggy and neglected basic housekeeping. Despite limiting my movement to only the bed and dining table, the house somehow became a mess. When my parents told me about their plan to leave, I told myself I would use this as an opportunity to redecorate the house, clean everything, and cook 3 meals for myself daily. Turns out I am just a lazy bum (surprise, surprise).

- But the interesting part about the whole episode is the fact that I felt zero guilt or remorse about being sloppy. I was fine with it. I think I would have usually gone on a spiral of blaming myself and in turn ’punished’ myself by being more sloppy. But good sense prevailed. On the sunday before my parents returned, I went out and treated myself to a good meal. The weather was spectacular. I felt good and slept off early. It took me all of 2 hours to clean up all the mess before my parents returned. They did not notice anything particularly messy. All good.

- More about the meal - I went to Broken Bridge cafe at MRC nagar. It’s a pretty good place. It is adjacent to Radio room so they serve alcohol also. I went alone, so I did not drink anything. They have something called ’Thayir sadham fritters’ which is basically hardened curd rice with narthanga, battered, fried, and served with a dip. It was pretty good. I could imagine it going well with drinks. Main course was a very good pasta. And the finishing note was ’Filter coffee Tiramisu’. Which is basically Tiramisu served in a brass davara-tumbler set. It is probably the best Tiramisu I’ve had till date. I liked the place a lot, and made a mental note to return with friends. Oh, and the waiter shared my name and treated me well despite me going alone.

- Apart from this, I got to meet a friend from college, try new breakfast cereal, and try another new dessert place. I don’t want to sound tedious by talking about the details. It was overall a good week in life. Hoping I return to routine this week.
