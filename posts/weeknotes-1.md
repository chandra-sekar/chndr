Okay, I am thinking of making a habit of writing week notes whenever I can.

- The week started with WWDC. I stayed up watching the entire Keynote. I found all the announcements pretty exciting.
- The Mac Pro announcement caught my imagination quite a bit. It was totally not meant for me and targetted at video and audio professionals. But I think there is an aspirational quality to the hardware. Made me want to do something that would make use of the hardware. It would be perfect for creative coding like the work of Joshua Davis. But I figure it might not be such a great idea for someone with motion sickness.
- On the other hand, I got pretty excited by the announcement of iPadOS. I love my iPad. I convinced myself to get it last year thinking it would somehow lead to better productivity. I resolved to use it only for note taking and reading and ended up not at all using the device that much at first. I later got to really love it as a consumption device. It is probably one of the favorite things I own. 
- I installed the developer beta of iPadOS with a friend's account and now I am just playing with all the new features. Using a mouse on the iPad was pretty cool. 
- I also ended up getting a Dual Shock controller from someone on OLX. Looking forward to using it to play games more often on the iPad.
- I am going to cut this update short because I am nearly out of time and Beeminder will charge me $10 if I don't post this now!
