Last week was quite eventful. We went to to Kalady for my dad's 60th birthday ceremony. It is considered an auspicious ocassion in some communities in India. The couple gets to have a wedding ceremony again when the husband reaches 60 years. The practice is patriarchal but it has been followed for generations. I know for a fact that I won't be celebrating my 60th birthday this way. But it was fun watching my parents get married again.

We had invited only limited people from our close circle. But even then, it was a tough job coordinating the accomodation for the guests, managing their pick up, drop and catering to everyone's needs. It gave me a small taste of what it would be like to manage a wedding and I am honestly not looking forward to this part.

It also happened to be my birthday week. I spent it in the company of my relatives for a change. A whole lot of people who I don't normally see wished me for my birthday this year.

I got to unwind at Trivandrum and just chill for sometime. I got to watch Frozen 2, Koode and Jiivi. I liked all of them to varying degrees. But none of them really stood out. I caught a cold and sore throat as a parting gift from Kerala. I am feeling tired and not really upto it. I hope this passes and I get to normal health soon. This is the second time in as many weeks I am falling sick. I will be watching my health closely to see if this is becoming a regular occurance.
