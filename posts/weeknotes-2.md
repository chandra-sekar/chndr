I skipped a week. But here are the week notes from last week.

- I am writing this on Monday morning instead of Friday evening like I intended. The first thing I am noticing is how tough it is to recollect events from even the past week. It's not like I am old, but it seems like the brain really likes to put things in a drawer as soon as it can and forget about it.

- Starting last month, I signed up for paid trial classes at Cult fitness and have been attending classes every weekday morning. The trial ended last week, and I had to decide if I wanted to continue. I like cult's format and their focus on showing up to class. For now, I have kind of decided I am not going ahead with the subscription inspite of maintaining a good attendance record. Cult did not have the option to pick monthly classes, and I did not trust myself with a long term plan. I have decided to take up classes at a local yoga centre instead. It is not a fancy place. They don't have a trial, so I'll be jumping in blind. But it is closer home and much cheaper. This seems like a bad decision on paper but I will know in a month's time :)

- Last week was pretty hectic on the work front. We are getting close to release date and I got to squash some bugs on a daily basis. Inspite of this, I got to watch two films in IMAX. I watched Men in black: International. It was okay. Not as bad as the reviews made it out to be. The aliens looked cool. The second film was Toy Story 4 and I loved it. Some of Pixar's recent films have had a bloated middle portion. Toy  4 does not have this problem. The jokes work, and the emotions hit the right spot. 

- I failed my beeminder cooking streak again and lost $10. This is turning out to be very expensive for me and it is starting to hurt. I really need to start cooking and fix my relationship with food. I am trying not to turn to food when I am feeling down. I think the key is keeping my fridge stocked and having a bunch of handy recipes in mind.

- Water shortage has hit Chennai in a bad way this summer. The lakes are all dry. Water supply is being rationed in my apartment. We've had a bit of rains over the last couple of days but it is far from enough. I hope we have a better monsoon this year and somehow get through this year.
