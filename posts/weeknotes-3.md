It is another Monday and here are the week notes from the past week
---

- I am cheating and including something from this morning in last week's notes. I attended Ramesh's wedding today. I thought he would be one of the last people in the school gang to get married, so it was quite a surprise when he announced it to everyone last week. It was a simple wedding in a small hall. No reception or any other rubbish. I appreciated how the whole thing was conducted without any fuss. Both of them looked happy. I am happy for them.

- Two weeks ago, I made the decision to sign up for local yoga classes instead of getting a subscription at Cult fitness. Turns out I am averse to going to classes where the teacher gives any sort of personal attention. I talked to this Yoga teacher on the phone and he instructed me to bring a notebook, a yoga mat, and to show up on time. I ended up not attending even a single class. I instead renewed my cult membership through the app, and I have been attending classes again since last week. I like the fact that I can simply open the app to book a class and just show up. It is impersonal but I somehow find this more comfortable.

- I have been short on sleep. Had a few late nights last week. We went out for Anand's birthday dinner on Friday and I got back only at 2AM. Soundarya hosted a farewell party before she leaves to Canada this month, and I again got back only past 2AM on Saturday. I slept late on Sunday and had to wake up at 5AM to attend the wedding this morning. I need to catch up on sleep and get back to proper routine this week. 

- As an aside, I am noticing that a LOT of people from my extended circle are moving to Canada. Getting a Canadian PR seems to be easy if you have a master's degree and a decent IELTS score. I have both, and my well meaning friends have been pestering me to apply for a PR. I somehow don't like the idea. I need to first get a TC from my college before I apply for the transcripts to be sent to Canada. And who has time for that? :P

- Last week I realised that my day gets derailed if something interferes with my morning routine. This could be a meeting, some support issue, or even some piece of news I want to read more about on Twitter. My goal this week is to aggressively defend my morning time. I've started coming to office only at 11AM in order to maintain some overlap with the rest of the team. This means I reach home late, and mornings are when I get to spend time for myself.

- I read Seneca's essay 'On the shortness of life' and found a lot to think about. It is amazing how advice from 2000 years ago is still relevant today. I immediately placed an order for Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations' and I am reading it right now. I am thinking I should write about it in detail once I am done.

- These posts are turning out to resemble long winded journal entries. I feel emboldened by the fact that no one is reading this. My original intention was to also post interesting links and videos from the past week. Maybe I should start collecting and posting them from next week.
