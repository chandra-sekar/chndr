description: Trying my hand at a cult favorite boardgame

This one is going to be short, so here it goes

- I managed to stick to a morning routine for most of last week. I got ample sleep and managed to not put on any weight, so that's good. I have been attending classes at Cult daily. As I posted last week, our water is being rationed and we get running water only till 9:30AM in the morning. This has proven to be a good thing because I am forced to finish my bath early and this gives me more quality time in the morning because I cannot sleep again after having my bath.

- I have been trying guided meditations using the 'Waking up' app on my phone. I paid for a discounted subscription when they launched and I am getting to use it only now. I like it. I am not sure if it is having a positive impact on my day, but I think I have a better understanding of what the practise of meditation is all about.

- I got to play board games after a long, long time. I also got to meet my gaming friends after a while. Had a good time. I got to play at this new board game cafe called The Board Room this time. It is pretty cool. Lot of natural light and a good menu. Chennai now has two proper board game cafes!

- We played Battlestar Galactica. I have been wanting to play it for a long time. It turned out to be a little long for what it is. But I am happy that I now have a grasp of the rules and would like to try it again with a different group perhaps.

- A couple from San Francisco who were at the cafe spotted us playing BSG and offered hints. They were pretty excited to see us play. The lady had a very cheerful face. They ended up helping us with the rules quite a bit. It was obvious that they had played the game a LOT and it looked like the game would benefit from having a regular group.

- Spent most of Sunday indoors. Went to the beach. Figured I'll try eating some pasta because it had been a while. It was horrible. Then figured I'll eat a Kulfi because it had been a while. It was also horrible. Came back slightly bummed. It was a happening sunday for sports fans, with the Wimbledon Final, Cricket World Cup Final, and F1 happening at the same time. Federer lost to a tie breaker and England won the World Cup after a super over. And I slept through all of it!
