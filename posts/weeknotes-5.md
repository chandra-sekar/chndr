- I hurt my back during workout. Nothing serious. Good thing that it happened closer to the weekend. I am recovering and must stick to Yoga classes next week.
- I spent the weekend watching a few films I have been meaning to catch up with. I watched 'Missing Link' from Laika Studios. They make gorgeous stop motion animated films. It was a good adventure film and well made, but I felt some parts of it were cliched. It did not stick with me after watching.
- I then watched 'Prince of Egypt'. It is a legit classic. Looks beautiful and the story is told with a lot of love and reverance. It does not shy away from showing the darker parts of the story. I think this might go down as one of my all time favorites. I am happy I finally got to watch it.
- I finished Saturday by watching 'State and Main'. I loved 'The Verdict' and wanted to find other films that were written by David Mamet. This was a low key romantic comedy with a great cast and I enjoyed it a lot. It has a calm vibe and great music. Rebecca Pidgeon was super cute. I am surprised she was not big in the 90s.
- I wanted to make more progress on this site but things haven't moved. Hoping to write about it and get things going this weekend.
- I have been listening to "Good Omens" on Libby as an Audiobook. It is narrated by Martin Jarvis and he does a very good job. I have a copy of the physical book as well. I started reading the book and tried listening to the same portions in the Audiobook. I did not find any of the humour missing in the audiobook. If anything, the dramatization made it more fun. This is such a great book.
- I have been spending a lot of time on Twitter and I think it is having a negative impact on my head. My goal next week will be to stay away from Twitter during week days.
