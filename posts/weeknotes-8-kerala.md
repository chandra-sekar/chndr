Last week turned out to be a week of traveling. The idea was to visit my friends in Kochi, where they were shooting their film. The trip was supposed to double up as a mini holiday. But it ended up being super hectic. Overall I got to meet my friends after a while, and that was the point. No regrets.

My original plan was to meet my friends in [Kochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi) and then head to [Trivandrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram) to meet another friend before taking the return train back. My dad gave me another work in [Anagamaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angamaly), which meant I had to take a mini trip from Kochi, and this involved being on the road for 5 hours. Added to this, I had to travel [RAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_against_Cancellation) for most of the journey on both trains to and from Kerala. As always, the so called break ended up being more hectic than my regular work life. I have decided I am never risking my trip on a wait listed/RAC ticket. It has failed for me so many times and sharing a berth with another passenger is just so uncomfortable.

I spent a good half day in [Varkala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varkala) with my friend. I liked the place. I made a mental note to plan a weekend trip to the place. Looking at the sea from a cliff never gets old. It had some nice cafes, and all of them have a great view of the sea. Coffee Temple, Darjeeling Cafe and Cafe Italiano are the places I ended up liking. 

Me and my friend played the tablet version of [Jaipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur_(card_game)) while we were sitting in Darjeeling Cafe and it was a surprisingly fun and a well done implementation. Almost as good as playing the cardboard version.
