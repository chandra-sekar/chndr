I just got back after watching Knives Out. I would usually take to Twitter if I wanted to gush about some movie I watched. Now that I am not on Twitter, I am resorting to writing about it here. 

I loved the film and I have been texting my friends to go watch it. It is an Agatha Christie-esque Whodunit set in a mansion. It is damn near perfectly written and directed. Daniel Craig does a great job as the archetypal detective. It is one of my favorite films of the year along with [Parasite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)).

Getting to what happened last week, I was down with a stomach bug and had to take a day off. Getting sick once in a while is a good reminder of the things we take for granted. I realized I need to fix my lifestyle and be stronger.

Apart from that, it was a pretty regular week. We have had good rains. It hopefully means Chennai has enough water to get through next summer.
